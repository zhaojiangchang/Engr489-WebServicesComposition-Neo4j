\abstract{A Web service is a software component that takes input data and produces output data. With the rapid development of computer network technology and applications, the demand for online services has grown, as has users' expectation that the quality of online services will meet their demands. Since a single Web service provides only limited functionality, in order to complete complex tasks, multiple Web services must be used, and it is necessary to combine, or compose these Web services to provide functions needed by users. The objective of service composition is to find a composite service that provides the best quality of service (QoS), in a challenging environment where the number of available services is rapidly increasing. In order to tackle the challenge of finding an efficient method for creating Web compositions with optimal QoS, we propose an automated QoS-Aware Web service composition approach using graph databases. This approach is efficient because with our approach dataset repositories are saved as graph databases, with Web services and their relationships stored permanently in these graph databases. Thus there is no need to regenerate relationships when processing given tasks.   }
